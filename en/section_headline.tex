With my last degree as a DevOps Engineer and 6 years of experience as a developer working with different languages like 
Java and Python. I have also experienced administrating and developing database environment like Postgresql and Oracle. 
I'm working today as a freelance, learning new skills and tools about technologies, automation and the most important, 
team work. I am interested in sharing and learning knowledge about new ways to build solutions. I wish to continue my career 
innovating on development projects as a software architect and/or developer/architect.
